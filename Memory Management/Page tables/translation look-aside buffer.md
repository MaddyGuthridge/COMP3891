Abbreviated as *TLB*.

Physical hardware on a CPU to accelerate page table lookups, acting as a cache. Aka *memory management unit*. It contains recently-used [[page table]] entries (usually 64-128 entries according to slides, but `cpuid` says my laptop has over 1500 L2 entries ðŸ¤”).

## How it works

1. Take [[virtual memory|virtual address]]
2. Get offset and [[page]] number
3. Look up page in TLB
4. If it is present, it is a *TLB hit*, and we can access that memory directly
5. If it isn't, it is a *TLB miss*, and we need to search the full page table

## Properties

- [[Page]] number
- [[Frame]] number
- Whether the translation is valid (as boolean)
- Whether the page is writable (as boolean)

## Hardware vs software TLBs
The system for handling TLB misses depends on on the CPU [[architecture]].

### x86 and ARM
TLB misses perform a page table lookup in hardware, then reload the table.
- This means the process is ***ðŸ”¥ BLAZINGLY FAST ðŸ”¥***
- But the [[kernel]] has very little control over it (you need to use the page table as designated by the CPU)

### [[MIPS]] and Itanium
TLB misses generate a *TLB miss [[exception]]* which must be handled by the [[kernel]]. The kernel uses hardware instructions to load the new entries into the TLB.
- This means the [[kernel]] has much more control over how the [[page table]] is defined
- But it's probably slower than a hardware-accelerated lookup

## TLBs and context switching
In order to make lookups as efficient as possible for [[process|processes]], TLB entries must either be process specific, or be tagged with an [[address space]] ID. Otherwise processes would be able to access memory belonging to other processes.

### Process-specific TLB entries
When a [[context switch]] occurs, the entire TLB needs to be flushed and refilled. This produces a high overhead for context switches, and was used on x86 CPUs (apparently not in modern ones though?).

### Address space ID tagging
Each TLB entry is tagged with an address space ID (ASID) which tells the CPU which process owns that address. This is used in some form by all modern architectures. TLBs that use this are called *tagged TLBs*.

## Performance
- Without a TLB, the number of [[physical memory]] lookups for a [[virtual memory]] lookup is 2
- With a TLB, if there is a 99% hit rate, [[physical memory]] lookups are reduced significantly, since the TLB allows a lookup to be done in one operation. $0.99 \times 1 + 0.01 \times 2 = 1.01$.
