Abbreviated as *TLB*.

Physical hardware on a CPU to accelerate page table lookups, acting as a cache. Aka *memory management unit*. It contains recently-used [[page table]] entries (usually 64-128 entries according to slides, but `cpuid` says my laptop has over 1500 L2 entries ðŸ¤”).

## How it works

1. Take [[virtual memory|virtual address]]
2. Get offset and [[page]] number
3. Look up page in TLB
4. If it is present, it is a *TLB hit*, and we can access that memory directly
5. If it isn't, it is a *TLB miss*, and we need to search the full page table, then perform a [[TLB refill]].

## Properties

- [[Page]] number
- [[Frame]] number
- Whether the translation is valid (as boolean)
- Whether the page is writable (as boolean)
- And other [[architecture]]-specific properties (see [[R3000 TLB]] for more info on the [[sys-161]] implementation).

## TLBs and context switching
In order to make lookups as efficient as possible for [[process|processes]], TLB entries must either be process specific, or be tagged with an [[address space]] ID. Otherwise processes would be able to access memory belonging to other processes.

### Process-specific TLB entries
When a [[context switch]] occurs, the entire TLB needs to be flushed and [[TLB refill|refilled]]. This produces a high overhead for context switches, and was used on x86 CPUs (apparently not in modern ones though?).

### Address space ID tagging
Each TLB entry is tagged with an [[address space ID]].

## Performance
- Without a TLB, the number of [[physical memory]] lookups for a [[virtual memory]] lookup is 2
- With a TLB, if there is a 99% hit rate, [[physical memory]] lookups are reduced significantly, since the TLB allows a lookup to be done in one operation. $0.99 \times 1 + 0.01 \times 2 = 1.01$.
