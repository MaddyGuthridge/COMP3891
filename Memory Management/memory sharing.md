It is often important to share memory between [[process|processes]], since this can greatly reduce overall memory consumption on a [[multiprogramming]] system.

## For [[multi-level page table|standard page tables]]

Too complicated AAAAAAAAAAA

## For [[hashed page table|hashed page tables]]

Just have both indexes map to the same [[frame]].
