Swap space allows a [[process]] to be temporarily moved out of memory to a "backing store", then brought back into the [[physical memory]] for continued execution.

- Transfers the whole process
- Backing store needs to be a fast disk or performance issues will happen
- Process priority can be used to determine which processes are swapped
- Slow transfer time
