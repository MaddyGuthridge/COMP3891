Batch [[scheduling]] is a category of [[scheduling algorithm]] which prioritises performance of jobs. Task switching is minimised to ensure that tasks have uninterrupted use of the system, avoiding the overhead of [[CPU]] [[context switch|context switches]].

Batch schedulers are most often used on systems where responsiveness isn't required, such as on build servers and supercomputers.
