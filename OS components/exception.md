An exception is not like exceptions used in high-level languages. Instead it is an event that causes the [[kernel]] to take over control of the CPU.

Exceptions can include
- [[syscall|syscalls]]
- interrupts
- [[translation look-aside buffer|TLB]] misses

In [[MIPS]] systems, info about exceptions can be gathered by checking values in [[coprocessor 0]].
