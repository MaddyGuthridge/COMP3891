There are many kinds of file systems, which all optimise for different things

- `Ext3` is optimised for hard drives
- `ISO9660` is optimised for CDs
- `FAT32` becomes inefficient for drives over 32 GB
- `ZFS` is designed to scale to multi-TB disk arrays
- `BTRFS` is designed to work well on modern drives (like SSDs)
- `NTFS` is closed-source, so good luck figuring it out
