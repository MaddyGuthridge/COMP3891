A text representation of what a file looks like.

File names can only contain certain data. Different [[operating system|operating systems]] and file systems have different conventions for this. Some common ones are:

- Case-sensitivity
	- Linux: yes
	- Windows/MacOS: no
- Restricted characters (eg no `/`)
- Can use naming conventions, but this is optional
	- Eg `.c` for C code
	- Sometimes these are operating system reserved, especially on Windows (eg `CON`)
