When a [[file]] is all over the place on the physical hard drive, it can make it slower, at least for HDD and tape storage. Doesn't matter so much for SSDs.

## External fragmentation
Wasted space external to allocated regions
- There is free space
- but since the space isn't contiguous, so they might not be usable

## Internal fragmentation
Wasted space internal to allocated regions
- A [[block]] is partially filled, remaining space is wasted
