When a [[file]] or [[memory resources]] is all over the place on the physical hard drive/memory, it can make it slower to access, particularly for reading, as it becomes more difficult to find free space.

## External fragmentation
Wasted space external to allocated regions
- There is free space
- but since the space isn't contiguous, so they might not be usable

## Internal fragmentation
Wasted space internal to allocated regions
- A [[block]]/[[frame]] is partially filled, remaining space is wasted
