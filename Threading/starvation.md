Starvation happens when some threads thread uses all resources, preventing other threads from getting any [[CPU]] time.

## Example

> Imagine you're in a queue to purchase food at a restaurant, for which pregnant women have priority. And there's just a whole bunch of pregnant women arriving all the time.
> You'll soon be starving. ;)
> Now imagine you are a low-priority process and the pregnant women are higher priority ones. =)
