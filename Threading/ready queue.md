- Queue of [[process]]es and [[thread]]s waiting to be run, ased on [[process state]]
- Blocked processes shouldn't be in the ready queue - otherwise they'd just slow things down as we'd need to search the read queue until we find a process that's actually ready
- Instead, create event queues, which contain the processes that are waiting for events
- Multiple processes/threads can wait for one event
