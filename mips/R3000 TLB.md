The [[MIPS R3000]] [[translation look-aside buffer|TLB]] uses 64-bit entries, split into 2 32-bit fields.

#### High register
|           |                               |                      |        |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| **bit**     | 31 - 12                       | 11 - 6               | 5 - 0  |
| **purpose** | [[page\|page number]] | [[address space ID]] | unused |

##### Suggestion from the lecturer
Don't use the [[address space ID|ASID]] when implementing assignment 4, it's more pain than it's worth.

#### Low register

|             |                         |                         |     |     |     |       |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| **bit**     | 31 - 12                 | 11                      | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7 - 0 |
| **purpose** | [[frame\|frame number]] | non-cacheable `bool` | writable `bool`    | valid `bool`    | Global (ignore ASID in lookup)    | unused      |

The `non-cacheable` value isn't implemented by [[os-161]], so its value doesn't matter.
